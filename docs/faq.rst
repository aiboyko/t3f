Frequently asked questions
==========================

What is *tensor* anyway?
------------------------
For most purposes, tensor is just a multidimensional array. For example, a matrix is a 2-dimensional array.

How to convert large scale tensors into the TT-format
-----------------------------------------------------
For small tensors, you can directly convert them into the TT-format by an SVD-based algorithm (e.g. with `t3f.to_tt_tensor`). For large tensor that do not fit to memory there are two ways: either try to approximate the TT-format by sampling a fraction of the tensor elements (see `TT-cross`_) or express your tensor analytically. For example, sometimes tensors can be expressed as arithmetic operations of simpler tensors, and for some functions (e.g. `exp` or `sin`) there are analytical expressions for the TT-format of their values on a grid.

What do people do with this *Tensor Train* format?
--------------------------------------------------
In machine learning, TT-format is used for compressing neural network layers (`fully-connected`_, convolutional_, recurrent_), speeding up `training of Gaussian processes`_, theoretical analysis of expressive power of Recurrent Neural Networks (one_ and two_), `high-dimensional nonlinear control`_, etc. See an `overview paper`_ for more information.

TT-format is also known in physics community under the name of Matrix Product State (MPS) and is extensively used.

Are there other tensor decompositions?
-------------------------------------
Yes! Most notable there are Canonical decomposition, Tucker, and Hierarchical Tucker decompositions. They all have their pros and cons, for instance many operations for Canonical decomposition are NP-hard; Tucker decomposition scales exponentially with the dimensionality of the tensor (and thus is inaplicable to tensors of dimensionality > 40). Hierarchical Tucker is very similar to TT-decomposition.

Where can I read more about this *Tensor Train* format?
-------------------------------------------------------
Look at the `paper`_ that proposed it. You can also check out my (Alexander Novikov's) slides_, from slide 3 to 14.

By the way, train means like actual train, with wheels. The name comes from the pictures like the one below that illustrate the Tensor Train format and naturally look like a train (at least they say so).
